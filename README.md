# Game Introduction

The concept of this game is based on a human's daily life. 

In this game, you will be asked to make some choices about activities you want to do, places you want to go, and items you want to buy in a market. The actual instruction will display in the console when you start the game. 

It will be in total of 3 days. The  1st Day is for activities, 2nd Day is for shopping in a market, and on the last day (the 3rd Day), you can choose to either do nothing or play a mini game. 

These are what this game will be in general. 

I'm proud of that mini game on the 3rd Day of this game. 

If I had more time, I would add more days into this game.
